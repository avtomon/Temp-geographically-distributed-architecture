# Temp-geographically-distributed-architecture
Simple geographically-distributed architecture description.

###Task:
The service includes a single page with a button. On the button, an integer is displayed and pressing the button increases its value by one. In order to press the button, the user has to be signed in, and the user can only press the button once every 24 hours.

Every day, millions of people from all corners of the world flock to the page to see the number increase, but only a small fraction of them have the courage to press the button.

You should, at least:

- list the programming language(s) you would use
- document any API's you would build
- document any database schemas you'd create
- draw a high-level architecture diagram
- describe how and where the service/its components would be deployed
- explain how you'd ensure the integrity of the core service
- focus on scalability, security and maintainability
